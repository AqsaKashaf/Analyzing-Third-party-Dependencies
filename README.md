# Analyzing Third Party Dependencies

This repo contains material for the IMC 2020 submission on third party dependencies 

## Folder Structure

For each service, DNS, CDN and CA we have a separate folder. We have included the analysis scripts in the scripts folder and the data folder contains the processed data.
For details on how we collect and process the data, please have a look at our IMC paper.
